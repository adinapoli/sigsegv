SIGSEGV - Lead a pointer to freedom
===================================

SIGSEGV is a slow paced, turn based, innovative game. 
Leap into the digital world of a pointer and lead him to freedom through a
series of brain-teasing levels.


The map Editor
==============
The map editor is a fancy tool a programmer can use to develop brand new levels. Since
a level is nothing more than a json file, the editor let you design elements in a grid
and storing them on disk. The map editor is written in Python and requires the most recent
version of PyGame.
